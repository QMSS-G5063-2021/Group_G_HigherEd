                  of student loans, accompanying with a clearer picture of his overall plan on student loan.
                  While he cancelled in total of 2.3 billion dollar of student loans for more than 110,000
                  student loan borrowers and received much apprais from the group, the reaction among all the
                  Americans on this controversial issue has been quiet different. Therefore, in this project,
                  our team want to investigate further on why student loan becomes a serious problem here in US,
                  as well as how people in US has reacted to the issue based on their talk on social medis platform.
                  
                  As discussed in other sections of our repository, this project sought to explore a factors
                  related to socioeconomic conditions, student debt, inequities, and policy. This was a really
                  broad topic so we did a decent amount of exploration of the data prior to deciding on a more
                  specific topic. We tried to focus on spefic aspects of the student loan issue including university
                  selectivity, family income, repayment rate over time, and the regional differnce of debt amount to
                  understand why student debt becomes a more and more serious problem that people in US now are
                  highly concern with. After understanding the issue and recognizing the problem, we then use
                  the information from Google trend and Twitter platform to see how people reatced and talked about it.",

                                 $1 billion in student loan forgiveness. Ever since this announcement, more people have
                                 been pushing for a more progressive policy and asking President Biden to cancel student
                                 debt through executive action. There is still a lot of uncertainties around whether a

                     two layers on the map to showcase patterns. The first layer tells us which states are most
                     concerned about student loan forgiveness by setting the radius of the circle to the total
                     tweets word count. The gradient color scale shows the sentiment score of each state where
                     red means a more negative average tweets sentiment and green means a more positive tweet
                     sentiment on average. In addition, the popup window shows the top tweets keywords in each
                     state after getting ride of most frequent keywords such as student, loan, debt,
                     cancelstudentdebt, and amp. In California, not only do people tweet the most about student
                     loan forgiveness, but they also have a more positive sentiment toward student loan forgiveness.
                     Other areas where there are more discussions on student loan forgiveness concentrate along the
                     coastal states. Midwestern states are least concerned about student loan forgiveness, and their
                     tweets sentiment is also more negative.
                     
                     The second layer shows where the selective institutions are located, where purple icon stands
                     for elite universities, green icon stands for highly selective universities, and blue icon
                     stands for selective universities. Overall, these selective universities are concentrated along the
                     coastlines. On the west coast, most of the selective universities are in California. And the
                     selective universities spread out more evenly on the east coast. Overall, we can see an overlap
                     by looking at the two layers together. States with higher concentration of selective schools
                     are also where people are most concerned about student loan forgiveness."))))))
