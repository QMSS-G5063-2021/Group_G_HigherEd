## Introduction 
As discussed in other sections of our repository, this project sought to explore a factors related to socioeconomic conditions, student debt, inequities, and policy. This was a realy broad topic so we did a decent amount of exploration of the data prior to deciding on a more specific topic. 

## The Data 
### College Scorecard 
We worked with the 2019 College Scorecard (and with the 2010-2019 College Scorecard) to look at some trends that we thought would be interesting. The following is the dataset and some basic columns added to it for our analysis work. One way we did this was through attaining and concatenating the College Scorecard data as directly downloaded from the NCES. Below are the columns we selected for this: 

```{r csv load, results="hide"}
# Set the WD as Group_G_HigherEd 
setwd("~/Dropbox (Business)/Spring 2021/QMSS 5063 - Data Visualization /Group_G_HigherEd")

# While our initial College Scorecard only included 2019 initially, I was able to run a simple python script to concatenate and select a small number of relevant columns for our visualization and analysis. Thus, as our first visualizations only unclude 2019, the code below is for re-filtering the concatenated 2010-2019 data back into simply 2019. 

sc_time <- read_csv('src/2010_2019_student_debt.csv') 
sc <- sc_time %>% filter(Year_Ending == 2019)

# Renaming Latitude and Longitude Columns for later use 
sc <- sc %>% dplyr::rename(lat = LATITUDE) %>% dplyr::rename(long = LONGITUDE) %>% dplyr::rename(state = STABBR)

#recoding for admissions rates (ADM_RATE) to note selectivity level of schools
sc <- sc %>% dplyr::mutate(uni_rank = ifelse(ADM_RATE<0.05,'elite',ifelse(ADM_RATE<0.2,'highly selective', ifelse(ADM_RATE<0.3, 'selective',ifelse(ADM_RATE<0.7,'less selective', 'not selective')))))
colnames(sc)
# Selectivity Categories were made guided by as-yet unpublished work from Conwell et al. (2022 exp.) [1] as well as by articles from the US News and Rankings 
sc <- sc %>%
  dplyr::mutate(uni_rank = case_when(
    ADM_RATE < 0.05 ~ 'elite',
    ADM_RATE < 0.2 ~ 'highly selective',
    ADM_RATE < 0.3 ~ 'more selective',
    ADM_RATE < 0.5 ~ 'selective',
    ADM_RATE < 0.7 ~ 'less selective',
    TRUE ~ 'not selective')) %>% mutate(uni_rank = factor(uni_rank, levels=c('not selective', 'less selective', 'selective', 'more selective', 'highly selective', 'elite')))
```

```{r initial map matching, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
us <- map_data("state")
us_states <- as_data_frame(us) %>% dplyr::rename(state=region)

mapping=aes(x = lat, y = long)
ggplot(us,  aes(x = long, y = lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(), color='white') + 
  theme_ipsum() + theme(panel.grid = element_blank())+ geom_point(data = sc, aes(x = long, y = lat, group=UNITID),color='gold',alpha=0.5)

```
  
  This dataset came with lat and lon columns, which made it somewhat easier to plot the universities without needing to Geocode their locations. 

  We also looked at data using the R package developed by the Urban Institute; specifically, we examined factors such as repayment rates. 


### Twitter Dataset  
  When we were further along in our data visualization strategy, we also used the Twitter API to attain Tweet data about student debt, searching for key hashtags involving student det, including #cancelstudentloandeby, #helpmiddleclassamericans, #zeropercentintereststudentloans as well as mentions of the terms 'borrower defense' and 'loan forgiveness.' 
  

## Projects 

As discussed in the introductory section, we had far too many subtopics within our dataset and we wanted to better explore a specific sub-topic prior to planning our visualizations. Thus, we began with trying to identify patterns within our dataset and other related datasets. 

We started by testing whether or not we would be able to generate a graph of where universities in the US are located. This was mostly to validate that the lat and lon columns were working properly and were not going to cause issues if we were to plot these institutions on a map. 

We then started trying to look at some trends that could be compiled into our visualization project. Some themes we were interested in were *race*, *socioeconomic status*, *student debt*, and *economic outcomes*.  

## Visuals Development Process 
This section of our notebook focuses on the information we have chosen to present for our visualizations and how we arrived at our current iterations. 

### Student Debt 
**Student Debt and School Competitiveness**
```{r competitiveness_student_debt, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
sc_sub <- sc %>% subset(DEBT_MDN != 'PrivacySuppressed') %>% drop_na(uni_rank) %>% drop_na(DEBT_MDN)
sc_sub$uni_rank_cat = factor(sc_sub$uni_rank, levels=c('elite','highly selective','selective','less selective','not selective'))

ggplot(sc_sub, aes(x=uni_rank_cat,y=DEBT_MDN)) +
  geom_point(color = '#87495F',alpha=.12) +
  theme_ipsum(base_size = 12, axis_title_size = 14) +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
      ggtitle("Student Debt and School Tiers") +    
  labs(fill = "Selectivity", y="Student Debt", x = "School Competitiveness")

```
This was not a very good visual but I wanted to see whether student debt varied relative to the 'eliteness' and the 'selectiveness' of the school. As can be somewhat seen above, elite schools and highly selective schools appear to potentially exhibit higher student debt on average.  

### Student Repayment Rates

In order to understand whether or not students are having more trouble with their increasing debts, we wanted to visualize repayment rates over time.  The data for this was very complicated:
| variable | description |
--------------------------
| unitid | unique school identifier |
| cohort_year | a group of students in a school who began repaying their loans in the same year |
| years_since_entering_repayment | the year of observation of the cohort since their first year |
| repay_rate | the proportion of students to make progress on their loans |
| repay_rate_<low/high/mid>income | same as repay rate, but the denominator is the fraction of students in various income brackets |
| repay_count | the number of students to make progress their loans (the numerator of repay_rate) |
| repay_count_<low/high/mid>income | number of students to make progress on their loans by income bracket |

This means that each university has multiple observations for each cohort_year (on each year of their repayment), and the same information as divided by income bracket.  And, this information was presented as either the numerator or the proportion of the all students to enter the repayment phase of their student loans.

Therefore, we wanted to visualize the variation in proportion of students to make progress on their loans over time.  And so, we took the median repayment rate for each cohort year in their first year of repayment and made the below plot:
```{r warning=F, message=F}
knitr::include_graphics("../../src/visuals/repay_rate_files/figure-html/repay_rate_ave_draft-1.png")
```
But, in order to control for variation in the number of students across schools, I remade the plot by

1. finding the denominator (total number of students in a cohort by income bracket)
2. grouping the data by cohort year and income level
3. summing the numerator (count of students who made progress on their loans) and
4. summing the denominator (total students who made progress on their loans)
5. calculating the rate by dividing the numerator and denminator for each cohort year in each income range

In addition to modifying the calculations, I made some changes in the visual representation:

1. different color palette that better indicates ordinal categorical scale for income
2. transformed y proportion to percentages
3. expanded y axis to be 0 to 100%
4. added notation to explain a fiscal cohort.

These changes yielded the below plot:
```{r warning=F, message=F}
knitr::include_graphics("../../src/visuals/repay_rate_files/figure-html/repay_rate_ave-1.png")
```

### Appendix: Trends Explored and Scrapped
```{r debt_race, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#dfsub %>% group_by(uni_rank) mutate(density = n()) 

m <- ggplot(sc_sub, aes(x=DEBT_MDN,y=UGDS_BLACK, color = uni_rank_cat)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = uni_rank_cat), alpha=.4) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("navy","lightblue","aquamarine3","orange","gold"))+
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)+
  theme_ipsum() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
      ggtitle("Student Debt and Racial Composition (Black Students)") +    
  labs(y="% Black Students", x = "Median Student Debt ($)")
m
```
  
  We also looked at debt and racial breakdown. As shown here, we did not identify a very clear trend - as such, I left 'race and student debt' alone for the time being as we were attempting to work on scaling down to more specific topics.  

## General Decisions  
  We tried to follow the principles we learned in class throughout our work. Specifically, we tried to show data comparatively,
