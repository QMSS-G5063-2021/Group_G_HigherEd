# Final Project Proposal
Name of Project: Group G Higher Education

# Introduction
Our project seeks to examine higher education institutions within the United States. Our plan is to map and examine key elements of higher ed institution characteristics using the NCES College Scorecard. This dataset is sponsored by the US Department of Education and published by the Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development (OPEPD).

# Project Rationale
The goal of the project is to look at the distribution and characteristics of higher-ed institutions across the US, and to identify some trends in terms of where 
the 'more exclusive' and 'better' schools are, as well as how these types of schools affect the economic outcomes of the student (for example, the amount of student
debt burden, the placement rate, etc.) To this point, the following are a few visualizations we are considering: 

- Mapping Excercise - we want to include an interactive map showing 2019 accredited universities across the US. We would consider color grouping these by category (e.g., Community College, Public University, Private Non-Profit, and Private For-Profit) and by size (enrollment in 2019). 
- Scatterplots - while this plotting method is quite basic, we can use scatterplots to glean insights around (for example) if schools requiring higher ACT scores (composite, maths, verbal) would tend to have higher placement rates or higher student debt. 
- Other Descriptive Graphs - showing the distribution of ACT scores, etc. as needed to illustrate characteristics of certain schools / regions / school categories. 
- *potential* Time-Series plotting - Depending on how interesting this question is, we can look at the changes of outcomes for students in groups of institutions (e.g., are placement rates after graduation shrinking for certain schools? are schools becoming more exclusive?) 
- *potential* Network Analysis - Schools are grouped in terms of their characteristics. If we can find another data set, it would be interesting to see if schools in the same sports network (e.g., Big 10). *this is not necessarily related to our preliminary purpose for visualization and may be extraneous to our visualization task.*

We are hoping on a technical level to implement many of the things we learned in class around aesthetic, informative, and interesting data visualizations. In particular, we are hoping that our visuals can be cohesive and tell a good story about the state of higher education in the United States. 

# Steps
1. Plot some initial descriptive visualizations to see what trends and characteristics of schools are interesting. 
2. Draft and scope our visualizations (ideas notebook) - not all visuals we look at are necessarily going to be interesting. 
3. Refine descriptive visualizations. 
4. Plot most interesting characteristics on US map (work on interactivity as well). 
5. Finalize with more advanced visualizations, consider working with networks or textual data. 

# Potential Challenges
- Some challenges that I would foresee include the handling of missing data - for example, certain community colleges and Private For-Profit 
- Also, this data set is quite abundant and may require some scoping. We want to avoid showing *everything* available on the data set as the focus of data visualization is to show something informative and interesting to the viewer rather than to overload the viewer with information. 

# Questions
- We are curious about how we can scope our visualizations (and whether we should). 
- We also want to know if our proposal is adquate on a technical basis (e.g., is there something we should be applying from our classes that we have not been accounting for in this proposal)? 
- For Prof. Brambor (also Nico and Yifei) - we are curious as to whether you have any other ideas of things that we should do with this data set, and whether there are other resources (packages on R, datasets, etc.) that you immediately can think of that can make our visualizations more interesting. 

# Relevant Links
Maybe include the links of our datasets or any sources that we cite.
