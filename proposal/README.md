# Final Project Proposal
Name of Project: Group G Higher Education

# Introduction
Our project seeks to examine higher education institutions within the United States. Our plan is to map and examine key elements of higher ed institution characteristics using the NCES College Scorecard. This dataset is sponsored by the US Department of Education and published by the Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development (OPEPD).

# Project Rationale
The goal of the project is to look at the distribution and characteristics of higher-ed institutions across the US, and to identify some trends in terms of where 
the 'more exclusive' and 'better' schools are, as well as how these types of schools affect the economic outcomes of the student (for example, the amount of student
debt burden, the placement rate, etc.) To this point, the following are a few visualizations we are considering: 

- Mapping Excercise - we want to include an interactive map showing 2019 accredited universities across the US. We would consider color grouping these by category (e.g., Community College, Public University, Private Non-Profit, and Private For-Profit) and by size (enrollment in 2019). 
- Scatterplots - while this plotting method is quite basic, we can use scatterplots to glean insights around (for example) if schools requiring higher ACT scores (composite, maths, verbal) would tend to have higher placement rates or higher student debt. 
- *potential* Time-Series plotting - Depending on how interesting this question is, we can look at the changes of outcomes for students in groups of institutions (e.g., are placement rates after graduation shrinking for certain schools? are schools becoming more exclusive?) 
- *potential* Network Analysis - Schools are grouped in terms of their characteristics. If we can find another data set, it would be interesting to see if schools in the same sports network (e.g., Big 10). *this is not necessarily related to our preliminary purpose for visualization and may be extraneous to our visualization task.*

We are hoping on a technical level to implement many of the things we learned in class around aesthetic, informative, and interesting data visualizations. In particular, we are hoping that our visuals can be cohesive and tell a good story about the state of higher education in the United States. 

# Steps
Outline the steps that we foresee ourselves taking to complete the purpose of the project.

# Potential Challenges
Highlight any challenges we see in completing the above-listed steps.

# Questions
Do we have any generael questions or specific questions for Prof. Brambor given our project?  For example, does the project proposal meet the expectations of the assignment?  How else might our project be useful?

# Relevant Links
Maybe include the links of our datasets or any sources that we cite.
